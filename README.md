## Overview

This repository is used to simulate pointfoot robot, such as limxdynamics TRON1.

**Keywords:** extension, locomotion, isaaclab, pointfoot

## Installation,

- Install Isaac Lab by following the [installation guide](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/source/setup/installation/index.html). We recommend using the conda installation as it simplifies calling Python scripts from the terminal.

- Clone the repository separately from the Isaac Lab installation (i.e. outside the `IsaacLab` directory):

```bash
# Option 1: HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/Andy-xiong6/pointfoot-IsaacLabExtension.git

# Option 2: SSH
git clone git@github.com:Andy-xiong6/pointfoot-IsaacLabExtension.git
```

```bash
# Enter the repository
cd pointfoot-IsaacLabExtension
```

- Using a python interpreter that has Isaac Lab installed, install the library

```bash
python -m pip install -e exts/pointfoot
```

- Verify that the extension is correctly installed by running the following command:

```bash
python scripts/rsl_rl/train.py --task={TASK_NAME}
```

- To play a trained model:

```bash
python scripts/play.py --task={TASK_NAME} --checkpoint_path=path/to/checkpoint
```

## Troubleshooting

### Pylance Missing Indexing of Extensions

In some VsCode versions, the indexing of part of the extensions is missing. In this case, add the path to your extension in `.vscode/settings.json` under the key `"python.analysis.extraPaths"`.

```json
{
    "python.analysis.extraPaths": [
        "<path-to-ext-repo>/exts/pointfoot"
    ]
}
```

### Pylance Crash

If you encounter a crash in `pylance`, it is probable that too many files are indexed and you run out of memory.
A possible solution is to exclude some of omniverse packages that are not used in your project.
To do so, modify `.vscode/settings.json` and comment out packages under the key `"python.analysis.extraPaths"`
Some examples of packages that can likely be excluded are:

```json
"<path-to-isaac-sim>/extscache/omni.anim.*"         // Animation packages
"<path-to-isaac-sim>/extscache/omni.kit.*"          // Kit UI tools
"<path-to-isaac-sim>/extscache/omni.graph.*"        // Graph UI tools
"<path-to-isaac-sim>/extscache/omni.services.*"     // Services tools
...
```
